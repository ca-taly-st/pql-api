Welcome to the Premier Quidditch League API! This repository provides a mock REST API for the development and testing of a team and player management interface for the Premier Quidditch League. 

This API is built using JSON Server, which simulates a real server with minimal setup.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (Download here: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/))
- npm (Comes installed with Node.js)

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ca-taly-st/pql-api.git

   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

    Install JSON Server globally on your machine:

    ```bash

    ```

3. **Start the JSON Server**
    
    Navigate to the project directory where db.json is located and start JSON Server:
